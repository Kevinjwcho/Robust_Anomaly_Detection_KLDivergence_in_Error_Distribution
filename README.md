# Robust Anomal Detection in Cyber Physical System using Kullback-Leibler Divergence in Error Distributions
* Cho, Jinwoo, et al. "Robust Anomaly Detection in Cyber Physical System using Kullback-Leibler Divergence in Error Distributions." 5th Workshop on Mining and Learning from Time Series (MileTSâ€™19), Anchorage, Alaska, USA. 2019.
* I used error after the neural network fitting. 
* I focused on the anamaly can be detected by comparing estimated error distribution.
* I used KL divergence as a measure to estimate the distance between distributions.
